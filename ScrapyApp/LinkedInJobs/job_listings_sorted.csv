Your key oversight areas will include system implementation/transformation, cyber security, and information technology risk management.

"Senior Director, Information Technology Operations",On-Ramps,"Albany, New York Metropolitan Area",3 days ago,"About The Organization

The ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) is the first animal welfare organization established in North America and serves as the nation's leading voice for animals. The organization's mission is to provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals throughout the United States. The ASPCA provides local and national leadership in three key areas protecting and rescuing animals from crisis, assisting animals in communities and advancing legal protection for animals.

The ASPCA was founded by Henry Bergh in 1866 on the belief that animals are entitled to kind and respectful treatment at the hands of humans, and must be protected under the law. Headquartered in New York City, the ASPCA maintains a full-service animal hospital, spay/neuter clinic, rehabilitation center for canine victims of cruelty, kitten nursery and adoption facility. In addition, the ASPCA announced a groundbreaking anti-cruelty partnership with the New York Police Department in 2013, which has resulted in a record-breaking number of arrests and animals' lives saved.

The ASPCA also operates programs and services that extend nationwide, including a National Field Response team that rescues animal victims of natural and man-made disasters, a fully-subsidized spay/neuter clinic in Los Angeles, a Behavioral Rehabilitation Center for fearful, under-socialized dogs, and a 24-hour, 365-day Animal Poison Control Center that provides pet owners and veterinarians with live, on-call assistance related to toxic products and substances. In 2015, the ASPCA acquired Humane Alliance, now called the ASPCA Spay Neuter Alliance, which is the nation's leading training and education organization focusing on high-quality, high-volume spay/neuter.

The ASPCA is a privately funded 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization supported by more than 2 million animal advocates across the country.

Global Director - Enterprise Applications,SVP Worldwide,"La Vergne, TN",2 months ago,"ABOUT THE COMPANY: SVP Sewing Brands is the world’s largest consumer sewing machine company, accounting for approximately one out of every three sewing machines sold annually across the globe. The company was founded in 1851, and its three iconic brands - SINGER ® , HUSQVARNA VIKING ® and PFAFF ® - each have delighted consumers for over 140 years. The Singer brand is the industry’s most recognized and ranks #1 in the industry in brand awareness, likelihood to purchase and overall quality, according to a recent Gallup survey. The Husqvarna Viking ® and Pfaff ® brands have a premium positioning that are regarded as the brands of choice for serious sewers and crafters.

The company’s corporate headquarters is located in Nashville, TN and is supplemented by regional headquarters/sales offices located in Milan (Italy), São Paulo (Brazil), and Sydney (Australia) that, combined, reach consumers in more than 180 countries. SVP has two manufacturing facilities in Asia and Latin America, two global R&D centers, a software development center in Europe and a global supply chain with distribution centers in all regions.

The products are sold across a network of sewing machine dealers, mass retailers (e.g., Costco, Walmart, Lidl, MediaMarkt, Carrefour), specialty retailers (e.g., Joann, Michaels), online retailers (e.g., Amazon, Tmall), distributors, and through the company’s ~200 internally-operated retail stores.

The Industry

The sewing machine industry is a global industry that is experiencing renewed growth. In developed markets, growth rates are projected to outpace GDP growth, according to Global Industry Analysts, Inc., the leading industry data source. Growth in these markets is driven by the Millennial generation that is increasingly attracted to personalization, crafts and self-expression (e.g., cosplay). In developing markets, the industry is expected to grow at 6.7% annually, fueled by the emerging middle class and the “need to sew” segment that uses sewing machines to support the household.

The Future

In 2018, SVP was acquired by Ares Management ( www.aresmgmt.com ), a leading asset manager with $125B+ assets under management. The new owner has made substantial investments to strengthen the balance sheet and set the company up for growth. Leveraging its brands, innovative products, motivated employees, global footprint, and the financial strength of the new owner, SVP is looking to compete more aggressively in the marketplace, accelerate growth, and attract talented team members.

Reporting to the Chief Information Officer, the Global Director, Enterprise Applications will be responsible for all key applications including: ERPs (JD Edwards, SAP, & UFI) + Retail POS + Digital/Marketing Websites + eCommerce (B2C & B2B) + Data Warehouse + Google Suite. The incumbent will partner closely with several key business functions (Finance + Sales + Supply Chain + Operations + R&D + Marketing + Legal + Human Resources) to further optimize, rationalize, & enhance applications that foster continued business enablement/growth .

"President, Digital Solutions",GA Telesis,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1 month ago,"Who we are

A wholly owned subsidiary of GA Telesis, LLC, BLOCKIT is a startup company in development mode focused on disrupting an industry in need of some disruption – electronic fund transfer (EFT) technology. Our SaaS products will play a direct role in peer-to-peer EFT interactions while preventing man-in-the-middle hacks. We created BLOCKIT for our own use, only to learn there were no other direct SaaS applications addressing this market, so our CEO and CTO decided to spin it out on its own and revolutionize the EFT information exchange with a strong dose of AI for continued fraud detection.

How we are different and better

We have created a SaaS focusing on EFT using blockchain technology. We differ from others in the fund space because we do not focus on being a middleman in a financial transaction. Ultimately, the fees associated with facilitating transactions in that space become too financially cumbersome for a company over the long-term and they try to develop a manner to do it on their own. That's what we did. Simply put, we want to provide a very low cost SaaS product to make sure that two or more parties can have a secure manner to share their EFT details, while using artificial intelligence to make sure we are constantly improving the highest level of system integrity.

How we're funded and where we're heading

The potential target market is global and that means we will require a lot of capital as we enter the market implementation phase. The good news is that the product development has been completely funded by our founding parent company and we remain funded by them and have some runway ahead. However, that will have its limits and we will need to go to market to raise additional capital in the near future. Good news is that the heavy lifting needed in terms of development dollars are behind us and future funding will focus on go to market implementation.

What you will be doing

You will work hand-in-hand with our CEO, CFO and CTO and be a key member of the management team. Our CTO has been the creative genius behind BLOCKIT and will be your counterpart. You should be willing and able to roll up your sleeves to work with our CTO on our full data and development stack and take our product to market. Your role will be focused on go to market strategy and implementation, including funding, sales and marketing, and building a winning team.

Who you are

You've ideally been a president or CTO (or similar role) of a startup SaaS company in the fintech or security space. You have start up experience, you get the difficulties you will face, and your varied background will help you navigate through the go-to-market phase. You thrive in a startup environment and as it relates to go-to-market, you have been there and done that at least once. You excel when you are challenged and sleep is not something you care about.

The ability to prove who you are is a basic human right and critical to a life of dignity and opportunity. But over 1 billion people, including over 230 million young children, are unable to prove their identity through any recognized means. As such, they are unable to access vital services, participate as a citizen or a voter, or transact in the modern economy.

There is increasing urgency, at many levels, to close this identity gap quickly, and by harnessing the power of information technology, address it digitally. But it is also plainly clear that digital ID, if not thoughtfully designed and carefully implemented, poses massive risk. And increased interest in closing the ID gap has, unfortunately, accelerated programs that pay little heed to privacy or user-management.

Founded in 2016, the ID2020 Alliance is a global partnership working to accelerate the adoption of user-managed, privacy-protecting and portable digital ID. We believe that sustained multi-stakeholder collaboration is vital to ensure that technology development is informed by the needs of countries and individuals and that programs and policies reflect recent technical innovations. And as a partnership of global organizations, we have a route to impact at a scale commensurate to the challenge.

Through our Certification and our consulting support to countries, companies and NGOs developing digital ID programs, ID2020's tech team is shaping the technical landscape to ensure that the digital ID solutions which are developed and adopted are user-managed, privacy-protecting and interoperable.

We have ambitious plans, and we know the most critical step is building an incredible team that brings fresh perspectives and a willingness to think outside the box. Our team is made up of people who both dream and do, and who infuse their work with a deep commitment to ID2020's mission and values, as articulated in the ID2020 Manifesto.
